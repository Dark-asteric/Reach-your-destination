I built this game in python by using OOP. I don't know the name of this game.
It is a console game.
The aim of this game is to reach your destination from starting position and there are some difficulties with different levels from 1 to 5 in your path.
Every time if you face difficulties, your life will decrease by 1 and the level of difficulties will decrease by 1 and, you will start from beginning.
Try this game and have some fun !!!
